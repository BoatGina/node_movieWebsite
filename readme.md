## summary from me
Thought this project , I have learned how to use node and others. I gained some knowledge about back-end.
Actually,it's better for us to read 《node.js深入浅出》 this book when starting learning node.js. I feel 
the book explain the node.js deeply and it's easy to read. And the node.js offical document explain it 
clearly too. The node_movieWebsite project make me pratice those tecnnologies.
